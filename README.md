## Inspiration
Many CS majors are applying to more jobs and internships than ever before. Most students are applying to over 10 internships, and it’s common for a student to apply to over 200. Tools which address this problem are trending up. For example, [Simplify](https://simplify.jobs/) has racked up 250,000 users by automatically filling in application fields (name, address, etc.) for you. However, traditional career advice argues that you should submit specific applications based on each company's needs, rather than apply to as many openings as possible. Personify provides a balance. We provide you with a tailor-made resume for each job you're applying for, helping you stand out and land your dream job in record time.

## Our Solution
We generate the best resume for a specific job based on your experience! Here's what you do:

If it's your first time using Personify, you create a profile. Create profile with your information and experiences. Put as much on the profile as possible!

Each time you want to apply to a job, log in, paste the job description, and click "Generate." We will make you the best resume possible! You can download the pdf and submit it immediately or download the LaTeX .tex file if you want to tweak it a little further!

## Example
