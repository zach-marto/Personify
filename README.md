## Inspiration
Many CS majors are applying to more jobs and internships than ever before. Most students are applying to over 10 internships, and it’s common for a student to apply to over 200. Tools which address this problem are trending up. For example, [Simplify](https://simplify.jobs/) has racked up 250,000 users by automatically filling in application fields (name, address, etc.) for you. However, traditional career advice argues that you should submit specific applications based on each company's needs, rather than apply to as many openings as possible. Personify provides a balance. We provide you with a tailor-made resume for each job you're applying for, helping you stand out and land your dream job in record time.

## What it does

If it's your first time using Personify, you create a profile. Create profile with your information and experiences. Put as much on the profile as possible!
